**Task Management API with Go and Gin**

This repository contains exercises and projects focused on learning Go programming language through practical implementations. Below is an overview of the exercises covered:

### 1. Developing a RESTful API with Go and Gin

In this exercise, we developed a RESTful API using Go programming language and Gin framework. The API provides endpoints for managing tasks, including functionalities such as creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving tasks.

### 2. Task Management API with MongoDB

To enhance the API's capabilities, we integrated MongoDB as the persistent data storage solution. This allowed us to store task data in a scalable and efficient manner, providing seamless data management for the Task Management API.

### 3. Implementing Authorization and Authentication with JWT

Security is a crucial aspect of any API. Therefore, we implemented JWT-based authorization and authentication mechanisms to ensure secure access to the Task Management API. This involved generating and validating JWT tokens for user authentication and authorization.

### 4. Go Backend Architecture

Understanding the architecture of backend applications is essential for building scalable and maintainable systems. We explored various architectural patterns and best practices for structuring Go backend applications, ensuring modularity, scalability, and testability.

### 5. Testing API in Go with Mockery and Testify

Testing is a critical aspect of software development. We utilized Mockery and Testify libraries to write comprehensive unit tests for our API endpoints. Mockery helped us generate mocks for interfaces, while Testify provided utilities for writing expressive and robust test cases.
